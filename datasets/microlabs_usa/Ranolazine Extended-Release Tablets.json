    "2 DOSAGE\u00a0AND\u00a0ADMINISTRATION": "\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1\tDosing InformationInitiate ranolazine dosing at 500 mg twice daily and increase to 1000 mg twice daily, as needed, based on clinical symptoms. Take ranolazine with or without meals. Swallow ranolazine tablets whole; do not crush, break, or chew.The maximum recommended daily dose of ranolazine is 1000 mg twice daily.If a dose of ranolazine is missed, take the prescribed dose at the next scheduled time; do not double the next dose.\n\n2.2\tDose ModificationDose adjustments may be needed when ranolazine is taken in combination with certain other drugs[seeDrug Interactions (7.1)]. Limit the maximum dose of ranolazine to 500 mg twice daily in patients on moderate CYP3A inhibitors such as diltiazem, verapamil, and erythromycin. Use of ranolazine with strong CYP3A inhibitors is contraindicated[seeContraindications (4),Drug Interactions (7.1)].Use of P-gp inhibitors, such as cyclosporine, may increase exposure to ranolazine. Titrate ranolazine based on clinical response[seeDrug Interactions (7.1)].\n",

    "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS": "\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1\tQT Interval ProlongationRanolazine blocks IKrand prolongs the QTc interval in a dose-related manner.Clinical experience in an acute coronary syndrome population did not show an increased risk of proarrhythmia or sudden death[seeClinical Studies (14.2)]. However, there is little experience with high doses (>1000 mg twice daily) or exposure, other QT- prolonging drugs, potassium channel variants resulting in a long QT interval, in patients with a family history of (or congenital) long QT syndrome, or in patients with known acquired QT interval prolongation.\n\n5.2\tRenal FailureAcute renal failure has been observed in some patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCL] <30 mL/min) while taking ranolazine. If acute renal failure develops (e.g., marked increase in serum creatinine associated with an increase in blood urea nitrogen [BUN]), discontinue ranolazine and treat appropriately[seeUse in Specific Populations (8.7)].Monitor renal function after initiation and periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CrCL <60 mL/min) for increases in serum creatinine accompanied by an increase in BUN.\n",
    "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS": "\n\n\n\n\n\n6.1\tClinical Trial ExperienceBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.A total of 2018 patients with chronic angina were treated with ranolazine in controlled clinical trials. Of the patients treated with ranolazine, 1026 were enrolled in three double- blind, placebo-controlled, randomized studies (CARISA, ERICA, MARISA) of up to 12 weeks\u2019 duration. In addition, upon study completion, 1251 patients received treatment with ranolazine in open-label, long-term studies; 1227 patients were exposed to ranolazine for more than 1 year, 613 patients for more than 2 years, 531 patients for more than 3 years, and 326 patients for more than 4 years.At recommended doses, about 6% of patients discontinued treatment with ranolazine because of an adverse event in controlled studies in angina patients compared to about 3% on placebo. The most common adverse events that led to discontinuation more frequently on ranolazine than placebo were dizziness (1.3% versus 0.1%), nausea (1% versus 0%), asthenia, constipation, and headache (each about 0.5% versus 0%). Doses above 1000 mg twice daily are poorly tolerated.In controlled clinical trials of angina patients, the most frequently reported treatment- emergent adverse reactions (>4% and more common on ranolazine than on placebo) were dizziness (6.2%), headache (5.5%), constipation (4.5%), and nausea (4.4%). Dizziness may be dose-related. In open-label, long-term treatment studies, a similar adverse reaction profile was observed.The following additional adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of 0.5 to 4.0% in patients treated with ranolazine and were more frequent than the incidence observed in placebo-treated patients:Cardiac Disorders\u2013 bradycardia, palpitationsEar and Labyrinth Disorders\u2013 tinnitus, vertigoEye Disorders \u2013blurred visionGastrointestinal Disorders\u2013 abdominal pain, dry mouth, vomiting, dyspepsiaGeneral Disorders and Administrative Site Adverse Events\u2013 asthenia, peripheral edemaMetabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013anorexiaNervous System Disorders \u2013syncope (vasovagal)Psychiatric Disorders \u2013confusional stateRenal and Urinary Disorders \u2013hematuriaRespiratory,Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders\u2013 dyspneaSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders \u2013hyperhidrosisVascular Disorders\u2013 hypotension, orthostatic hypotensionOther (<0.5%) but potentially medically important adverse reactions observed more frequently with ranolazine than placebo treatment in all controlled studies included: angioedema, renal failure, eosinophilia, chromaturia, blood urea increased, hypoesthesia, paresthesia, tremor, pulmonary fibrosis, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and pancytopenia.A large clinical trial in acute coronary syndrome patients was unsuccessful in demonstrating a benefit for ranolazine, but there was no apparent proarrhythmic effect in these high-risk patients[seeClinical Studies (14.2)].Laboratory Abnormalities:Ranolazine produces elevations of serum creatinine by 0.1 mg/dL, regardless of previous renal function, likely because of inhibition of creatinine\u2019s tubular secretion. In general, the elevation has a rapid onset, shows no signs of progression during long-term therapy, is reversible after discontinuation of ranolazine, and is not accompanied by changes in BUN. In healthy volunteers, ranolazine1000 mg twice daily had no effect upon the glomerular filtration rate. More marked and progressive increases in serum creatinine, associated with increases in BUN or potassium, indicating acute renal failure, have been reported after initiation of ranolazine in patients with severe renal impairment[seeWarnings and Precautions (5.2),Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].\n\n6.2\tPostmarketing ExperienceThe following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of ranolazine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure:Nervous System Disorders\u2013 Abnormal coordination, myoclonus, paresthesia, tremor, and other serious neurologic adverse events have been reported to occur, sometimes concurrently, in patients taking ranolazine. The onset of events was often associated with an increase in ranolazine dose or exposure. Many patients reported symptom resolution following drug discontinuation or dose decrease.Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders\u2013 Cases of hypoglycemia have been reported in diabetic patients on antidiabetic medication.Psychiatric Disorders\u2013 hallucinationRenal and Urinary Disorders\u2013 dysuria, urinary retentionSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders\u2013 angioedema, pruritus, rash\n",
    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS": "\n\n\n\n\n\n7.1\tEffects of Other Drugs on RanolazineStrong CYP3A InhibitorsDo not use ranolazine with strong CYP3A inhibitors, including ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, indinavir, and saquinavir[seeContraindications (4),Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].Moderate CYP3A InhibitorsLimit the dose of ranolazine to 500 mg twice daily in patients on moderate CYP3A inhibitors, including diltiazem, verapamil, erythromycin, fluconazole, and grapefruit juice or grapefruit-containing products[seeDosage and Administration (2.2),Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].P-gp InhibitorsConcomitant use of ranolazine and P-gp inhibitors, such as cyclosporine, may result in increases in ranolazine concentrations. Titrate ranolazine based on clinical response in patients concomitantly treated with predominant P-gp inhibitors such as cyclosporine[seeDosage and Administration (2.2)].CYP3A InducersDo not use ranolazine with CYP3A inducers such as rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and St. John\u2019s wort[seeContraindications (4),Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\n\n7.2\tEffects of Ranolazine on Other DrugsDrugs Metabolized by CYP3ALimit the dose of simvastatin in patients on any dose of ranolazine to 20 mg once daily, when ranolazine is co-administered. Dose adjustment of other sensitive CYP3A substrates (e.g., lovastatin) and CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic range (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus) may be required as ranolazine may increase plasma concentrations of these drugs[seeClinical Pharmacology (12.3)].Drugs Transported by P-gpConcomitant use of ranolazine and digoxin results in increased exposure to digoxin. The dose of digoxin may have to be adjusted[seeClinical Pharmacology (12.3)].Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6The exposure to CYP2D6 substrates, such as tricyclic antidepressants and antipsychotics, may be increased during co-administration with ranolazine, and lower doses of these drugs may be required.Drugs Transported by OCT2In subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, concomitant use of ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily and metformin results in increased plasma levels of metformin. When ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily is co-administered with metformin, metformin dose should not exceed 1700 mg/day. Monitor blood glucose levels and risks associated with high exposures of metformin.Metformin exposure was not significantly increased when given with ranolazine 500 mg twice daily[seeClinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\n",
    "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS": "\n\n\n\n\n\n8.1 PregnancyRisk SummaryThere are no available data on ranolazine use in pregnant women to inform any drug- associated risks. Studies in rats and rabbits showed no evidence of fetal harm at exposures 4 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD)(see Data).In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage of clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.DataAnimal DataEmbryofetal toxicity studies were conducted in rats and rabbits orally administered ranolazine during organogenesis. In rats, decreased fetal weight and reduced ossification were observed at doses (corresponding to 4-fold the AUC for the MRHD) that caused maternal weight loss. No adverse fetal effects were observed in either species exposed (AUC) to ranolazine at exposures (AUC) equal to the MRHD.\n\n8.2 LactationRisk SummaryThere are no data on the presence of ranolazine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. However, ranolazine is present in rat milk[seeUse in Specific Populations (8.1)]. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for ranolazine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from ranolazine or from the underlying maternal condition.Adult female rats were administered ranolazine orally from gestation day 6 through postnatal day 20. No adverse effects on pup development, behavior, or reproduction parameters were observed at a maternal dosage level of 60 mg/kg/day (equal to the MHRD based on AUC). At maternally toxic doses, male and female pups exhibited increased mortality and decreased body weight, and female pups showed increased motor activity. The pups were potentially exposed to low amounts of ranolazine via the maternal milk.\n\n8.4 Pediatric UseSafety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients.\n\n8.5 Geriatric UseOf the chronic angina patients treated with ranolazine in controlled studies, 496 (48%) were \u226565 years of age, and 114 (11%) were \u226575 years of age. No overall differences in efficacy were observed between older and younger patients. There were no differences in safety for patients \u226565 years compared to younger patients, but patients \u226575 years of age on ranolazine, compared to placebo, had a higher incidence of adverse events, serious adverse events, and drug discontinuations due to adverse events. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should usually start at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease, or other drug therapy.\n\n8.6\tUse in Patients with Hepatic ImpairmentRanolazine is contraindicated in patients with liver cirrhosis. In a study of cirrhotic patients, the Cmaxof ranolazine was increased 30% in cirrhotic patients with mild (Child- Pugh Class A) hepatic impairment, but increased 80% in cirrhotic patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment compared to patients without hepatic impairment. This increase was not enough to account for the 3-fold increase in QT prolongation seen in cirrhotic patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment[seeClinical Pharmacology (12.2)].\n\n8.7\tUse in Patients with Renal ImpairmentA pharmacokinetic study of ranolazine in subjects with severe renal impairment (CrCL <30 mL/min) was stopped when 2 of 4 subjects developed acute renal failure after receiving ranolazine 500 mg twice daily for 5 days (lead-in phase) followed by 1000 mg twice a day (1 dose in one subject and 11 doses in the other). Increases in creatinine, BUN, and potassium were observed in 3 subjects during the 500 mg lead-in phase. One subject required hemodialysis, while the other 2 subjects improved upon drug discontinuation[seeWarnings and Precautions (5.2)].Monitor renal function periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment. Discontinue ranolazine if acute renal failure develops.In a separate study, Cmaxwas increased between 40% and 50% in patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment compared to patients with no renal impairment, suggesting a similar increase in exposure in patients with renal failure independent of the degree of impairment. The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine has not been assessed in patients on dialysis.\n\n8.8\tUse in Patients with Heart FailureHeart failure (NYHA Class I to IV) had no significant effect on ranolazine pharmacokinetics. Ranolazine had minimal effects on heart rate and blood pressure in patients with angina and heart failure NYHA Class I to IV. No dose adjustment of ranolazine is required in patients with heart failure.\n\n8.9\tUse in Patients with Diabetes MellitusA population pharmacokinetic evaluation of data from angina patients and healthy subjects showed no effect of diabetes on ranolazine pharmacokinetics. No dose adjustment is required in patients with diabetes.Ranolazine produces small reductions in HbA1c in patients with diabetes, the clinical significance of which is unknown. Ranolazine should not be considered a treatment for diabetes.\n",
    "10 OVERDOSAGE": "\n\n\n\n\n\nHypotension, QT prolongation, bradycardia, myoclonic activity, severe tremor, unsteady gait/incoordination, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, dysphasia, and hallucinations have been seen in cases of oral overdose of ranolazine. In cases of extreme overdose of ranolazine fatal outcomes have been reported. In clinical studies, high intravenous exposure resulted in diplopia, paresthesia, confusion, and syncope.\n\n\n\nIn addition to general supportive measures, continuous ECG monitoring may be warranted in the event of overdose.\n\n\n\nSince ranolazine is about 62% bound to plasma proteins, hemodialysis is unlikely to be effective in clearing ranolazine.\n\n\n",
    "11 DESCRIPTION": "\n\n\n\n\n\nRanolazine extended-release tablet is available as a film-coated, non-scored, extended-release tablet for oral administration.\n\n\n\nRanolazine is a racemic mixture, chemically described as 1-piperazineacetamide,N\u00ad (2, 6-dimethylphenyl)-4-[2-hydroxy-3-(2-methoxyphenoxy) propyl]-, (\u00b1)-. It has an empirical formula of C24H33N3O4, a molecular weight of 427.54 g/mole, and the following structural formula:\n\n\n\nRanolazine is a white to off-white crystalline powder. Ranolazine is soluble in dichloromethane and methanol; sparingly soluble in tetrahydrofuran, and acetonitrile; slightly soluble in\u00a0toluene.\n\n\n\nRanolazine extended-release tablets contain 500 mg or 1000 mg of ranolazine and the following inactive ingredients: hypromellose, magnesium stearate, methacrylic acid copolymer Type C (Copolymer based on ethyl acrylate and methacrylic acid and the surface-active agent such as sodium lauryl sulfate and polysorbate 80), microcrystalline cellulose and sodium hydroxide. Additional inactive ingredients for the 500 mg tablet include Macrogol/PEG, polyvinyl alcohol, polysorbate 80, sodium lauryl sulfate, talc, Iron Oxide Yellow, Iron Oxide Red and titanium dioxide; additional inactive ingredients for the 1000 mg tablet include lactose monohydrate, triacetin, Iron Oxide Yellow and titanium dioxide.\n",
    "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY": "\n\n\n\n\n\n12.1 Mechanism of ActionThe mechanism of action of ranolazine\u2019s antianginal effects has not been determined. Ranolazine has anti-ischemic and antianginal effects that do not depend upon reductions in heart rate or blood pressure. It does not affect the rate-pressure product, a measure of myocardial work, at maximal exercise. Ranolazine at therapeutic levels can inhibit the cardiac late sodium current (INa). However, the relationship of this inhibition to angina symptoms is uncertain.The QT prolongation effect of ranolazine on the surface electrocardiogram is the result of inhibition of IKr, which prolongs the ventricular action potential.\n\n12.2 PharmacodynamicsHemodynamic EffectsPatients with chronic angina treated with ranolazine in controlled clinical studies had minimal changes in mean heart rate (<2 bpm) and systolic blood pressure (<3 mm Hg). Similar results were observed in subgroups of patients with CHF NYHA Class I or II, diabetes, or reactive airway disease, and in elderly patients.Electrocardiographic EffectsDose and plasma concentration-related increases in the QTc interval[seeWarnings and Precautions (5.1)],reductions in T wave amplitude, and, in some cases, notched T waves, have been observed in patients treated with ranolazine. These effects are believed to be caused by ranolazine and not by its metabolites. The relationship between the change in QTc and ranolazine plasma concentrations is linear, with a slope of about 2.6 msec/1000 ng/mL, through exposures corresponding to doses several-fold higher than the maximum recommended dose of 1000 mg twice daily. The variable blood levels attained after a given dose of ranolazine give a wide range of effects on QTc. At Tmaxfollowing repeat dosing at 1000 mg twice daily, the mean change in QTc is about 6 msec, but in the 5% of the population with the highest plasma concentrations, the prolongation of QTc is at least 15 msec. In cirrhotic subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, the relationship between plasma level of ranolazine and QTc is much steeper[seeContraindications (4)].Age, weight, gender, race, heart rate, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and renal impairment did not alter the slope of the QTc-concentration relationship of ranolazine.No proarrhythmic effects were observed on 7-day Holter recordings in 3162 acute coronary syndrome patients treated with ranolazine. There was a significantly lower incidence of arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia, bradycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, and new atrial fibrillation) in patients treated with ranolazine (80%) versus placebo (87%), including ventricular tachycardia \u22653 beats (52% versus 61%). However, this difference in arrhythmias did not lead to a reduction in mortality, a reduction in arrhythmia hospitalization, or a reduction in arrhythmia symptoms.\n\n12.3 PharmacokineticsRanolazine is extensively metabolized in the gut and liver and its absorption is highly variable. For example, at a dose of 1000 mg twice daily, the mean steady-state Cmaxwas 2600 ng/mL with 95% confidence limits of 400 and 6100 ng/mL. The pharmacokinetics of the (+) R- and (-) S-enantiomers of ranolazine are similar in healthy volunteers. The apparent terminal half-life of ranolazine is 7 hours. Steady state is generally achieved within 3 days of twice-daily dosing with ranolazine. At steady state over the dose range of 500 to 1000 mg twice daily, Cmaxand AUC0 to\u00a0tincrease slightly more than proportionally to dose, 2.2- and 2.4-fold, respectively. With twice-daily dosing, the trough: peak ratio of the ranolazine plasma concentration is 0.3 to 0.6. The pharmacokinetics of ranolazine is unaffected by age, gender, or food.Absorption and DistributionAfter oral administration of ranolazine, peak plasma concentrations of ranolazine are reached between 2 and 5 hours. After oral administration of14C-ranolazine as a solution, 73% of the dose is systemically available as ranolazine or metabolites. The bioavailability of ranolazine from ranolazine tablets relative to that from a solution of ranolazine is 76%. Because ranolazine is a substrate of P-gp, inhibitors of P-gp may increase the absorption of ranolazine.Food (high-fat breakfast) has no important effect on the Cmaxand AUC of ranolazine. Therefore, ranolazine may be taken without regard to meals. Over the concentration range of 0.25 to 10 \u00b5g/mL, ranolazine is approximately 62% bound to human plasma proteins.Metabolism and ExcretionRanolazine is metabolized mainly by CYP3A and, to a lesser extent, by CYP2D6. Following a single oral dose of ranolazine solution, approximately 75% of the dose is excreted in urine and 25% in feces. Ranolazine is metabolized rapidly and extensively in the liver and intestine; less than 5% is excreted unchanged in urine and feces. The pharmacologic activity of the metabolites has not been well characterized. After dosing to steady state with 500 mg to 1500 mg twice daily, the four most abundant metabolites in plasma have AUC values ranging from about 5 to 33% that of ranolazine, and display apparent half-lives ranging from 6 to 22 hours.Drug InteractionsEffect of Other Drugs on RanolazineIn vitro data indicate that ranolazine is a substrate of CYP3A and, to a lesser degree, of CYP2D6. Ranolazine is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein.Strong CYP3A InhibitorsPlasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 220% when co-administered with ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily[seeContraindications (4)].Moderate CYP3A InhibitorsPlasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily are increased by 50 to 130% by diltiazem 180 to 360 mg, respectively. Plasma levels of ranolazine with ranolazine 750 mg twice daily are increased by 100% by verapamil 120 mg three times daily[seeDrug Interactions (7.1)].Weak CYP3A InhibitorsThe weak CYP3A inhibitors simvastatin (20 mg once daily) and cimetidine (400 mg three times daily) do not increase the exposure to ranolazine in healthy volunteers.CYP3A InducersRifampin 600 mg once daily decreases the plasma concentrations of ranolazine (1000 mg twice daily) by approximately 95%[seeContraindications (4)].CYP2D6 InhibitorsParoxetine 20 mg once daily increased ranolazine concentrations by 20% in healthy volunteers receiving ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily. No dose adjustment of ranolazine is required in patients treated with CYP2D6 inhibitors.DigoxinPlasma concentrations of ranolazine are not significantly altered by concomitant digoxin at 0.125 mg once daily.Effect of Ranolazine on Other DrugsIn vitro ranolazine and its O-demethylated metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A and moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6 and P-gp. In vitro ranolazine is an inhibitor of OCT2.CYP3A SubstratesThe plasma levels of simvastatin, a CYP3A substrate, and its active metabolite are increased by 100% in healthy volunteers receiving 80 mg once daily and ranolazine1000 mg twice daily[seeDrug Interactions (7.2)]. Mean exposure to atorvastatin (80 mg daily) is increased by 40% following co-administration with ranolazine (1000 mg twice daily) in healthy volunteers. However, in one subject the exposure to atorvastatin and metabolites was increased by ~400% in the presence of ranolazine.DiltiazemThe pharmacokinetics of diltiazem is not affected by ranolazine in healthy volunteers receiving diltiazem 60 mg three times daily and ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily.P-gp SubstratesRanolazine increases digoxin concentrations by 50% in healthy volunteers receiving ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily and digoxin 0.125 mg once daily[seeDrug Interactions (7.2)].CYP2D6 SubstratesRanolazine 750 mg twice daily increases the plasma concentrations of a single dose of immediate release metoprolol (100 mg), a CYP2D6 substrate, by 80% in extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers with no need for dose adjustment of metoprolol. In extensive metabolizers of dextromethorphan, a substrate of CYP2D6, ranolazine inhibits partially the formation of the main metabolite dextrorphan.OCT2 SubstratesIn subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the exposure to metformin is increased by 40% and 80% following administration of ranolazine 500 mg twice daily and 1000 mg twice daily, respectively. If co-administered with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily, do not exceed metformin doses of 1700 mg/day[seeDrug Interactions (7.2)].\n",
    "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY": "\n\n\n\n\n\n13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment Of FertilityRanolazine tested negative for genotoxic potential in the following assays: Ames bacterial mutation assay, Saccharomyces assay for mitotic gene conversion, chromosomal aberrations assay in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, mammalian CHO/HGPRT gene mutation assay, and mouse and rat bone marrow micronucleus assays.There was no evidence of carcinogenic potential in mice or rats. The highest oral doses used in the carcinogenicity studies were 150 mg/kg/day for 21 months in rats (900 mg/m2/day) and 50 mg/kg/day for 24 months in mice (150 mg/m2/day). These maximally tolerated doses are 0.8 and 0.1 times, respectively, the daily maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 2000 mg on a surface area basis. A published study reported that ranolazine promoted tumor formation and progression to malignancy when given to transgenic APC (min/+) mice at a dose of 30 mg/kg twice daily[seeReferences (15)].The clinical significance of this finding is unclear.In male and female rats, oral administration of ranolazine that produced exposures (AUC) approximatelty 3-fold or 5-fold higher, respectively, than the MRHD had no effect on fertility.\n",
    "14 CLINICAL STUDIES": "\n\n\n\n\n\n14.1\tChronic Stable AnginaCARISA (Combination Assessment of Ranolazine In Stable Angina) was a study in 823 chronic angina patients randomized to receive 12 weeks of treatment with twice-daily ranolazine 750 mg, 1000 mg, or placebo, who also continued on daily doses of atenolol 50 mg, amlodipine 5 mg, or diltiazem CD 180 mg. Sublingual nitrates were used in this study as needed.In this trial, statistically significant (p <0.05) increases in modified Bruce treadmill exercise duration and time to angina were observed for each ranolazine dose versus placebo, at both trough (12 hours after dosing) and peak (4 hours after dosing) plasma levels, with minimal effects on blood pressure and heart rate. The changes versus placebo in exercise parameters are presented in Table 1. Exercise treadmill results showed no increase in effect on exercise at the 1000 mg dose compared to the 750 mg dose.Table 1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Exercise Treadmill Results (CARISA)Mean Difference from Placebo (sec)StudyCARISA (N=791)RanolazineTwice-daily Dose750 mg1000 mgExercise DurationTroughPeak24a34b24a26aTime to AnginaTroughPeak30a38b26a38bTime to 1 mm ST-Segment DepressionTroughPeak2041b2135bap-value \u22640.05bp-value \u22640.005The effects of ranolazine on angina frequency and nitroglycerin use are shown in Table 2.Table 2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Angina Frequency and Nitroglycerin Use (CARISA)PlaceboRanolazine750 mgaRanolazine1000 mgaAngina Frequency (attacks/week)N258272261Mean3.32.52.1P-value vs placebo\u20140.006<0.001Nitroglycerin Use (doses/week)N252262244Mean3.12.11.8P-value vs placebo\u20140.016<0.001aTwice dailyTolerance to ranolazine did not develop after 12 weeks of therapy. Rebound increases in angina, as measured by exercise duration, have not been observed following abrupt discontinuation of ranolazine.Ranolazine has been evaluated in patients with chronic angina who remained symptomatic despite treatment with the maximum dose of an antianginal agent. In the ERICA (Efficacy of Ranolazine In Chronic Angina) trial, 565 patients were randomized to receive an initial dose of ranolazine 500 mg twice daily or placebo for 1 week, followed by 6 weeks of treatment with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily or placebo, in addition to concomitant treatment with amlodipine 10 mg once daily. In addition, 45% of the study population also received long-acting nitrates. Sublingual nitrates were used as needed to treat angina episodes. Results are shown in Table 3. Statistically significant decreases in angina attack frequency (p=0.028) and nitroglycerin use (p=0.014) were observed with ranolazine compared to placebo. These treatment effects appeared consistent across age and use of long-acting nitrates.Table 3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Angina Frequency and Nitroglycerin Use (ERICA)PlaceboRanolazineaAngina Frequency (attacks/week)N281277Mean4.33.3Median2.42.2Nitroglycerin Use (doses/week)N281277Mean3.62.7Median1.71.3a1000 mg twice dailyGenderEffects on angina frequency and exercise tolerance were considerably smaller in women than in men. In CARISA, the improvement in Exercise Tolerance Test (ETT) in females was about 33% of that in males at the 1000 mg twice-daily dose level. In ERICA, where the primary endpoint was angina attack frequency, the mean reduction in weekly angina attacks was 0.3 for females and 1.3 for males.RaceThere were insufficient numbers of non-Caucasian patients to allow for analyses of efficacy or safety by racial subgroup.\n\n14.2\tLack of Benefit in Acute Coronary SyndromeIn a large (n=6560) placebo-controlled trial (MERLIN-TIMI 36) in patients with acute coronary syndrome, there was no benefit shown on outcome measures. However, the study is somewhat reassuring regarding proarrhythmic risks, as ventricular arrhythmias were less common on ranolazine[seeClinical Pharmacology (12.2)], and there was no difference between ranolazine and placebo in the risk of all-cause mortality (relative risk ranolazine: placebo 0.99 with an upper 95% confidence limit of 1.22).\n",
