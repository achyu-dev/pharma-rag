    "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE": "\n\n\n\n\n\nPiroxicam capsule is indicated:\n\n\n\nFor relief of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis.For relief of the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis.\n",
    "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION": "\n\n\n\n\n\nCarefully consider the potential benefits and risks of piroxicam and other treatment options before deciding to use piroxicam. Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals[seeWarnings and Precautions (5)].\n\n\n\nAfter observing the response to initial therapy with piroxicam, the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient\u2019s needs.\n\n\n\nFor the relief of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, the dosage is 20 mg given orally once per day. If desired, the daily dose may be divided. Because of the long half-life of piroxicam, steady-state blood levels are not reached for 7 to 12 days. Therefore, although the therapeutic effects of piroxicam are evident early in treatment, there is a progressive increase in response over several weeks and the effect of therapy should not be assessed for two weeks.\n",

Severe, sometimes fatal, anaphylactic reactions to NSAIDs have been reported in such patients[seeWarnings and Precautions (5.7,5.8)]In the setting of CABG surgery[seeWarnings and Precautions (5.1)]\n",
    "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS": "\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1 Cardiovascular Thrombotic EventsClinical trials of several cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses.To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as piroxicam, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events[seeWarnings and Precautions (5.2)].Status Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) SurgeryTwo large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10 to 14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of CABG[seeContraindications (4)].Post-MI PatientsObservational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post-MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up.Avoid the use of piroxicam in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If piroxicam is used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia.\n\n5.2 Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and PerforationNSAIDs, including piroxicam, cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3 to 6 months, and in about 2% to 4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short-term NSAID therapy is not without risk.Risk Factors for GI Bleeding, Ulceration, and PerforationPatients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, antiplatelet drugs (such as aspirin), anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding.Strategies to Minimize the GI Risks in NSAID-Treated Patients:Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration.Avoid administration of more than one NSAID at a time.Avoid use in patients at higher risk unless benefits are expected to outweigh the increased risk of bleeding. For such patients, as well as those with active GI bleeding, consider alternate therapies other than NSAIDs.Remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy.If a serious GI adverse event is suspected, promptly initiate evaluation and treatment, and discontinue piroxicam until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out.In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, monitor patients more closely for evidence of GI bleeding[seeDrug Interactions (7)].\n\n5.3 HepatotoxicityElevations of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (three or more times the upper limit of normal [ULN]) have been reported in approximately 1% of NSAID-treated patients in clinical trials. In addition, rare, sometimes fatal, cases of severe hepatic injury, including fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis, and hepatic failure have been reported.Elevations of ALT or AST (less than three times ULN) may occur in up to 15% of patients treated with NSAIDs including piroxicam.Inform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, diarrhea, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and \"flu-like\" symptoms). If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash), discontinue piroxicam immediately, and perform a clinical evaluation of the patient.\n\n5.4 HypertensionNSAIDs, including piroxicam, can lead to new onset of hypertension or worsening of preexisting hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs[seeDrug Interactions (7)].Monitor blood pressure (BP) during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy.\n\n5.5 Heart Failure and EdemaThe Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists\u2019 Collaboration meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated an approximately two-fold increase in hospitalizations for heart failure in COX-2 selective-treated patients and nonselective NSAID-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. In a Danish National Registry study of patients with heart failure, NSAID use increased the risk of MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and death.Additionally, fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs. Use of piroxicam may blunt the CV effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions (e.g., diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs])[seeDrug Interactions (7)].Avoid the use of piroxicam in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure. If piroxicam is used in patients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure.\n\n5.6 Renal Toxicity and HyperkalemiaRenal ToxicityLong-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury.Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of piroxicam in patients with advanced renal disease. The renal effects of piroxicam may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with preexisting renal disease.Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating piroxicam capsule. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia during use of piroxicam[seeDrug Interactions (7)].Avoid the use of piroxicam in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. If piroxicam is used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function.HyperkalemiaIncreases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, have been reported with use of NSAIDs, even in some patients without renal impairment. In patients with normal renal function, these effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism state.\n\n5.7 Anaphylactic ReactionsPiroxicam has been associated with anaphylactic reactions in patients with and without known hypersensitivity to piroxicam and in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma[seeContraindications (4)andWarnings and Precautions (5.8)].Seek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs.\n\n5.8 Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin SensitivityA subpopulation of patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma which may include chronic rhinosinusitis complicated by nasal polyps; severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm; and/or intolerance to aspirin and other NSAIDs. Because cross-reactivity between aspirin and other NSAIDs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, piroxicam is contraindicated in patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity[seeContraindications (4)]. When piroxicam is used in patients with preexisting asthma (without known aspirin sensitivity), monitor patients for changes in the signs and symptoms of asthma.\n\n5.9 Serious Skin ReactionsNSAIDs, including piroxicam, can cause serious skin adverse reactions such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. NSAIDs canalsocause fixed drug eruption (FDE). FDE may present as a more severe variant known as generalized bullous fixed drug eruption (GBFDE),whichcan be life-threatening. These serious events may occur without warning. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of serious skin reactions, and to discontinue the use of piroxicam at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. Piroxicam is contraindicated in patients with previous serious skin reactions to NSAIDs[seeContraindications (4)].\n\n5.10 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) has been reported in patients taking NSAIDs such as piroxicam. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling. Other clinical manifestations may include hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis. Sometimes symptoms of DRESS may resemble an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its presentation, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, discontinue piroxicam and evaluate the patient immediately.\n\n5.11 Fetal ToxicityPremature Closure of Fetal Ductus ArteriosusAvoid use of NSAIDs, including piroxicam, in pregnant women at about 30 weeks gestation and later. NSAIDs, including piroxicam, increase the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus at approximately this gestational age.Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal ImpairmentUse of NSAIDs, including piroxicam, at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy may cause fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation.Oligohydramnios is often, but not always, reversible with treatment discontinuation. Complications of prolonged oligohydramnios may, for example, include limb contractures and delayed lung maturation. In some postmarketing cases of impaired neonatal renal function, invasive procedures such as exchange transfusion or dialysis were required.If NSAID treatment is necessary between about 20 weeks and 30 weeks gestation, limit piroxicam use to the lowest effective dose and shortest duration possible. Consider ultrasound monitoring of amniotic fluid if piroxicam treatment extends beyond 48 hours. Discontinue piroxicam if oligohydramnios occurs and follow up according to clinical practice[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].\n\n5.12 Hematologic ToxicityAnemia has occurred in NSAID-treated patients. This may be due to occult or gross blood loss, fluid retention, or an incompletely described effect on erythropoiesis. If a patient treated with piroxicam has any signs or symptoms of anemia, monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit.NSAIDs, including piroxicam, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Co-morbid conditions such as coagulation disorders, concomitant use of warfarin, other anticoagulants, antiplatelet drugs (e.g., aspirin), SSRIs, and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may increase this risk. Monitor these patients for signs of bleeding[seeDrug Interactions (7)].\n\n5.13 Masking of Inflammation and FeverThe pharmacological activity of piroxicam in reducing inflammation, and possibly fever, may diminish the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections.\n\n5.14 Laboratory MonitoringBecause serious GI bleeding, hepatotoxicity, and renal injury can occur without warning symptoms or signs, consider monitoring patients on long-term NSAID treatment with a complete blood count (CBC) and a chemistry profile periodically[seeWarnings and Precautions (5.2,5.3,5.6)].\n\n5.15 Ophthalmologic EffectsBecause of reports of adverse eye findings with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, it is recommended that patients who develop visual complaints during treatment with piroxicam have ophthalmic evaluations.\n",
    "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS": "\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling:\n\n\n\nCardiovascular Thrombotic Events[seeWarnings and Precautions (5.1)]GI Bleeding, Ulceration and Perforation[seeWarnings and Precautions (5.2)]Hepatotoxicity[seeWarnings and Precautions (5.3)]Hypertension[seeWarnings and Precautions (5.4)]Heart Failure and Edema[seeWarnings and Precautions (5.5)]Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia[seeWarnings and Precautions (5.6)]Anaphylactic Reactions[seeWarnings and Precautions (5.7)]Serious Skin Reactions[seeWarnings and Precautions (5.9)]Hematologic Toxicity[seeWarnings and Precautions (5.12)]\n\n6.1 Clinical Trials ExperienceBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.In patients taking piroxicam or other NSAIDs, the most frequently reported adverse experiences occurring in approximately 1% to 10% of patients are:Cardiovascular System: EdemaDigestive System:Anorexia, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, flatulence, nausea, vomitingNervous System:Dizziness, headache, vertigoSkin and Appendages:Pruritus, rashSpecial Senses:TinnitusAdditional adverse experiences reported occasionally include:Cardiovascular System: PalpitationsDigestive System: StomatitisNervous System: DrowsinessSpecial Senses: Blurred vision\n\n6.2 Postmarketing ExperienceThe following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of piroxicam.

    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS": "\n\n\n\n\n\nSee Table 1 for clinically significant drug interactions with piroxicam.\n\n\n\nTable 1: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Piroxicam\n\nDrugs That Interfere with HemostasisClinical Impact:Piroxicam and anticoagulants such as warfarin have a synergistic effect on bleeding. The concomitant use of piroxicam and anticoagulants have an increased risk of serious bleeding compared to the use of either drug alone.Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Case-control and cohort epidemiological studies showed that concomitant use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and an NSAID may potentiate the risk of bleeding more than an NSAID alone.Intervention:Monitor patients with concomitant use of piroxicam with anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin), antiplatelet drugs (e.g., aspirin), SSRIs, and SNRIs for signs of bleeding[seeWarnings and Precautions (5.12)].AspirinClinical Impact:Controlled clinical studies showed that the concomitant use of NSAIDs and analgesic doses of aspirin does not produce any greater therapeutic effect than the use of NSAIDs alone. In a clinical study, the concomitant use of an NSAID and aspirin was associated with a significantly increased incidence of GI adverse reactions as compared to use of the NSAID alone[seeWarnings and Precautions (5.2)].Intervention:Concomitant use of piroxicam and analgesic doses of aspirin is not generally recommended because of the increased risk of bleeding[seeWarnings and Precautions (5.12)].Piroxicam is not a substitute for low dose aspirin for cardiovascular protection.ACE Inhibitors, Angiotensin Receptor Blockers, and Beta-BlockersClinical Impact:NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or beta-blockers (including propranolol).In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or have renal impairment, co-administration of an NSAID with ACE inhibitors or ARBs may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible.Intervention:During concomitant use of piroxicam and ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or beta-blockers, monitor blood pressure to ensure that the desired blood pressure is obtained.During concomitant use of piroxicam and ACE inhibitors or ARBs in patients who are elderly, volume-depleted, or have impaired renal function, monitor for signs of worsening renal function[seeWarnings and Precautions (5.6)].When these drugs are administered concomitantly, patients should be adequately hydrated. Assess renal function at the beginning of the concomitant treatment and periodically thereafter.DiureticsClinical Impact:Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations, showed that NSAIDs reduced the natriuretic effect of loop diuretics (e.g., furosemide) and thiazide diuretics in some patients. This effect has been attributed to the NSAID inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis.Intervention:During concomitant use of piroxicam with diuretics, observe patients for signs of worsening renal function, in addition to assuring diuretic efficacy including antihypertensive effects[seeWarnings and Precautions (5.6)].DigoxinClinical Impact:The concomitant use of piroxicam with digoxin has been reported to increase the serum concentration and prolong the half-life of digoxin.Intervention:During concomitant use of piroxicam and digoxin, monitor serum digoxin levels.LithiumClinical Impact:NSAIDs have produced elevations in plasma lithium levels and reductions in renal lithium clearance.The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15%, and the renal clearance decreased by approximately 20%. This effect has been attributed to NSAID inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis.Intervention:During concomitant use of piroxicam and lithium, monitor patients for signs of lithium toxicity.MethotrexateClinical Impact:Concomitant use of NSAIDs and methotrexate may increase the risk for methotrexate toxicity (e.g., neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, renal dysfunction).Intervention:During concomitant use of piroxicam and methotrexate, monitor patients for methotrexate toxicity.CyclosporineClinical Impact:Concomitant use of piroxicam and cyclosporine may increase cyclosporine\u2019s nephrotoxicity.Intervention:During concomitant use of piroxicam and cyclosporine, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function.NSAIDs and SalicylatesClinical Impact:Concomitant use of piroxicam with other NSAIDs or salicylates (e.g., diflunisal, salsalate) increases the risk of GI toxicity, with little or no increase in efficacy[seeWarnings and Precautions (5.2)].Intervention:The concomitant use of piroxicam with other NSAIDs or salicylates is not recommended.PemetrexedClinical Impact:Concomitant use of piroxicam and pemetrexed may increase the risk of pemetrexed-associated myelosuppression, renal, and GI toxicity (see the pemetrexed prescribing information).Intervention:During concomitant use of piroxicam and pemetrexed, in patients with renal impairment whose creatinine clearance ranges from 45 to 79 mL/min, monitor for myelosuppression, renal and GI toxicity.NSAIDs with short elimination half-lives (e.g., diclofenac, indomethacin) should be avoided for a period of two days before, the day of, and two days following administration of pemetrexed.In the absence of data regarding potential interaction between pemetrexed and NSAIDs with longer half-lives (e.g., meloxicam, nabumetone), patients taking these NSAIDs should interrupt dosing for at least five days before, the day of, and two days following pemetrexed administration.Highly Protein Bound DrugsClinical Impact:Piroxicam is highly protein bound and, therefore, might be expected to displace other protein bound drugs.Intervention:Physicians should closely monitor patients for a change in dosage requirements when administering piroxicam to patients on other highly protein bound drugs.CorticosteroidsClinical Impact:Concomitant use of corticosteroids with piroxicam may increase the risk of GI ulceration or bleeding.Intervention:Monitor patients with concomitant use of piroxicam with corticosteroids for signs of bleeding[seeWarnings and Precautions (5.2)].\n",
    "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS": "\n\n\n\n\n\n8.1 PregnancyRisk SummaryUse of NSAIDs, including piroxicam, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus and fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment.Because of these risks, limit dose and duration of piroxicam use between about 20 and 30 weeks of gestation, and avoid piroxicam use at about 30 weeks of gestation and later in pregnancy(see Clinical Considerations, Data).Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus ArteriosusUse of NSAIDs, including piroxicam, at about 30 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy increases the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus.Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal ImpairmentUse of NSAIDs at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy has been associated with cases of fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment.Data from observational studies regarding other potential embryofetal risks of NSAID use in women in the first or second trimesters of pregnancy are inconclusive. In animal reproduction studies in rats and rabbits, there was no evidence of teratogenicity at exposures up to 5 and 10 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD), respectively. In rat studies with piroxicam, fetotoxicity (postimplantation loss) was observed at exposures 2 times the MRHD, and delayed parturition and an increased incidence of stillbirth were noted at doses equivalent to the MRHD of piroxicam. Based on animal data, prostaglandins have been shown to have an important role in endometrial vascular permeability, blastocyst implantation, and decidualization. In animal studies, administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors such as piroxicam, resulted in increased pre- and post-implantation loss. Prostaglandins also have been shown to have an important role in fetal kidney development. In published animal studies, prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors have been reported to impair kidney development when administered at clinically relevant doses.The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population(s) is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.Clinical ConsiderationsFetal/Neonatal Adverse ReactionsPremature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus:Avoid use of NSAIDs in women at about 30 weeks gestation and later in pregnancy, because NSAIDs, including piroxicam, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus(see Data).Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment:If an NSAID is necessary at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy, limit the use to the lowest effective dose and shortest duration possible. If piroxicam treatment extends beyond 48 hours, consider monitoring with ultrasound for oligohydramnios. If oligohydramnios occurs, discontinue piroxicam and follow up according to clinical practice(see Data).Labor or DeliveryThere are no studies on the effects of piroxicam during labor or delivery. In animal studies, NSAIDS, including piroxicam inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, cause delayed parturition, and increase the incidence of stillbirth.DataHuman DataPremature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus:Published literature reports that the use of NSAIDs at about 30 weeks of gestation and later in pregnancy may cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus.Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment:Published studies and postmarketing reports describe maternal NSAID use at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy associated with fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation. In many cases, but not all, the decrease in amniotic fluid was transient and reversible with cessation of the drug. There have been a limited number of case reports of maternal NSAID use and neonatal renal dysfunction without oligohydramnios, some of which were irreversible. Some cases of neonatal renal dysfunction required treatment with invasive procedures, such as exchange transfusion or dialysis.Methodological limitations of these postmarketing studies and reports include lack of a control group; limited information regarding dose, duration, and timing of drug exposure; and concomitant use of other medications. These limitations preclude establishing a reliable estimate of the risk of adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes with maternal NSAID use. Because the published safety data on neonatal outcomes involved mostly preterm infants, the generalizability of certain reported risks to the full-term infant exposed to NSAIDs through maternal use is uncertain.Animal DataPregnant rats administered piroxicam at 2, 5, or 10 mg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis (Gestation Days 6 to 15) demonstrated increased post-implantation losses with 5 and 10 mg/kg/day of piroxicam (equivalent to 2 and 5 times the MRHD, of 20 mg respectively, based on a mg/m2body surface area [BSA]). There were no drug-related developmental abnormalities noted in offspring. Gastrointestinal tract toxicity was increased in pregnant rats in the last trimester of pregnancy compared to non-pregnant rats or rats in earlier trimesters of pregnancy. Pregnant rabbits administered piroxicam at 2, 5, or 10 mg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis (Gestation Days 7 to 18) demonstrated no drug-related developmental abnormalities in offspring (up to 10 times the MRHD based on a mg/m2BSA).In a pre- and post-natal development study in which pregnant rats were administered piroxicam at 2, 5, or 10 mg/kg/day on Gestation Day 15 through delivery and weaning of offspring, reduced weight gain and death were observed in dams at 10 mg/kg/day (5 times the MRHD based on a mg/m2BSA) starting on Gestation Day 20. Treated dams revealed peritonitis, adhesions, gastric bleeding, hemorrhagic enteritis and dead fetusesin utero. Parturition was delayed and there was an increased incidence of stillbirth in all piroxicam-treated groups (at doses equivalent to the MRHD). Postnatal development could not be reliably assessed due to the absence of maternal care secondary to severe maternal toxicity.\n\n8.2 LactationRisk SummaryLimited data from 2 published reports that included a total of 6 breastfeeding women and 2 infants showed piroxicam is excreted in human milk at approximately 1% to 3% of the maternal concentration. No accumulation of piroxicam occurred in milk relative to that in maternal plasma during treatment. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for piroxicam and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from the piroxicam or from the underlying maternal condition.\n\n8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive PotentialInfertilityFemalesBased on the mechanism of action, the use of prostaglandin-mediated NSAIDs, including piroxicam, may delay or prevent rupture of ovarian follicles, which has been associated with reversible infertility in some women. Published animal studies have shown that administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors has the potential to disrupt prostaglandin-mediated follicular rupture required for ovulation. Small studies in women treated with NSAIDs have also shown a reversible delay in ovulation. Consider withdrawal of NSAIDs, including piroxicam, in women who have difficulties conceiving or who are undergoing investigation of infertility.\n\n8.4 Pediatric UsePiroxicam has not been investigated in pediatric patients. The safety and effectiveness of piroxicam have not been established.\n\n8.5 Geriatric UseElderly patients, compared to younger patients, are at greater risk for NSAID-associated serious cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and/or renal adverse reactions. If the anticipated benefit for the elderly patient outweighs these potential risks, start dosing at the low end of the dosing range, and monitor patients for adverse effects[seeWarnings and Precautions (5.1,5.2,5.3,5.6,5.14)].\n",
    "10 OVERDOSAGE": "\n\n\n\n\n\nSymptoms following acute NSAID overdoses have been typically limited to lethargy, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain, which are generally reversible with supportive care. Gastrointestinal bleeding has occurred. Hypertension, acute renal failure, respiratory depression, and coma have occurred, but were rare[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1,5.2,5.4,5.6)].Manage patients with symptomatic and supportive care following an acute NSAID overdose. There are no specific antidotes. It is advisable to contact a poison control center (1-800-222-1222) to determine the latest recommendations because strategies for the management of overdose are continually evolving.If gastric decontamination may be potentially beneficial to the patient, e.g., short time since ingestion or a large overdosage (5 to 10 times the recommended dosage), consider emesis and/or activated charcoal (60 grams to 100 grams in adults, 1 gram to 2 grams per kg of body weight in pediatric patients) and/or an osmotic cathartic in symptomatic patients.The long plasma half-life of piroxicam should be considered when treating an overdose with piroxicam. Forced diuresis, alkalinization of urine, hemodialysis, or hemoperfusion may not be useful due to high protein binding.\n\n\n",

    "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY": "\n\n\n\n\n\n12.1 Mechanism of ActionPiroxicam has analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties.The mechanism of action of piroxicam, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2).Piroxicam is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin (PG) synthesisin vitro. Piroxicam concentrations reached during therapy have producedin vivoeffects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because piroxicam is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues.\n\n12.3 PharmacokineticsGeneral Pharmacokinetic CharacteristicsThe pharmacokinetics of piroxicam have been characterized in healthy subjects, special populations and patients. The pharmacokinetics of piroxicam are linear. Proportional increase in exposure is observed with increasing doses. The prolonged half-life (50 hours) results in the maintenance of relatively stable plasma concentrations throughout the day on once daily doses and significant accumulation upon multiple dosing. Most patients approximate steady state plasma levels within 7 to 12 days. Higher levels, which approximate steady state at two to three weeks, have been observed in patients in whom longer plasma half-lives of piroxicam occurred.AbsorptionPiroxicam is well absorbed following oral administration. Drug plasma concentrations are proportional for 10 mg and 20 mg doses and generally peak within three to five hours after administration. A single 20 mg dose generally produces peak piroxicam plasma levels of 1.5 mcg/mL to 2 mcg/mL, while maximum drug plasma concentrations, after repeated daily administration of 20 mg piroxicam, usually stabilize at 3 mcg/mL to 8 mcg/mL.With food there is a slight delay in the rate but not the extent of absorption following oral administration. The concomitant administration of antacids (aluminum hydroxide or aluminum hydroxide with magnesium hydroxide) have been shown to have no effect on the plasma levels of orally administered piroxicam.DistributionThe apparent volume of distribution of piroxicam is approximately 0.14 L/kg. Ninety nine percent of plasma piroxicam is bound to plasma proteins. Piroxicam is excreted into human milk. The presence in breast milk has been determined during initial and long term conditions (52 days). Piroxicam appeared in breast milk at approximately 1% to 3% of the maternal concentration. No accumulation of piroxicam occurred in milk relative to that in plasma during treatment.EliminationMetabolismMetabolism of piroxicam occurs by hydroxylation at the 5 position of the pyridyl side chain and conjugation of this product; by cyclodehydration; and by a sequence of reactions involving hydrolysis of the amide linkage, decarboxylation, ring contraction, and N-demethylation.In vitrostudies indicate cytochrome P4502C9 (CYP2C9) as the main enzyme involved in the formation to the 5\u2032-hydroxy-piroxicam, the major metabolite[seeClinical Pharmacology (12.5)]. The biotransformation products of piroxicam metabolism are reported to not have any anti-inflammatory activity.Higher systemic exposure of piroxicam has been noted in subjects with CYP2C9 polymorphisms compared to normal metabolizer type subjects[seeClinical Pharmacology (12.5)].ExcretionPiroxicam and its biotransformation products are excreted in urine and feces, with about twice as much appearing in the urine as in the feces. Approximately 5% of a piroxicam dose is excreted unchanged. The plasma half-life (t\u00bd) for piroxicam is approximately 50 hours.Specific PopulationsPediatricPiroxicam has not been investigated in pediatric patients.RacePharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been identified.Hepatic ImpairmentThe effects of hepatic disease on piroxicam pharmacokinetics have not been established. However, a substantial portion of piroxicam elimination occurs by hepatic metabolism. Consequently, patients with hepatic disease may require reduced doses of piroxicam as compared to patients with normal hepatic function.Renal ImpairmentPiroxicam pharmacokinetics have been investigated in patients with renal insufficiency. Studies indicate patients with mild to moderate renal impairment may not require dosing adjustments. However, the pharmacokinetic properties of piroxicam in patients with severe renal insufficiency or those receiving hemodialysis are not known.Drug Interaction StudiesAntacidsConcomitant administration of antacids had no effect on piroxicam plasma levels.AspirinWhen piroxicam was administered with aspirin, its protein binding was reduced, although the clearance of free piroxicam was not altered. Plasma levels of piroxicam were decreased to approximately 80% of their normal values when piroxicam capsule was administered (20 mg/day) in conjunction with aspirin (3900 mg/day). The clinical significance of this interaction is not known[seeDrug Interactions (7)].\n\n12.5 PharmacogenomicsCYP2C9 activity is reduced in individuals with genetic polymorphisms, such as the CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 polymorphisms. Limited data from two published reports showed that subjects with heterozygous CYP2C9*1/*2 (n=9), heterozygous CYP2C9*1/*3 (n=9), and homozygous CYP2C9*3/*3 (n=1) genotypes showed 1.7-, 1.7-, and 5.3-fold higher piroxicam systemic levels, respectively, than the subjects with CYP2C9*1/*1 (n=17, normal metabolizer genotype) following administration of a single oral dose. The mean elimination half-life values of piroxicam for subjects with CYP2C9*1/*3 (n=9) and CYP2C9*3/*3 (n=1) genotypes were 1.7- and 8.8-fold higher than subjects with CYP2C9*1/*1 (n=17). It is estimated that the frequency of the homozygous*3/*3 genotype is 0% to 1% in the population at large; however, frequencies as high as 5.7% have been reported in certain ethnic groups.Poor Metabolizers of CYP2C9 Substrates:In patients who are known or suspected to be poor CYP2C9 metabolizers based on genotype or previous history/experience with other CYP2C9 substrates (such as warfarin and phenytoin) consider dose reduction as they may have abnormally high plasma levels due to reduced metabolic clearance.\n",
